# Naive Bayes

This project is just some throwaway code written to poke at
naive bayes implementations in Python, Ruby and maybe other
languages in the future.

## to do

* Finish chapter in python ML book. This will take a while. Will need to be
subtasked.
  ** Add unit testing while finishing chapter.
  ** Add fixtures directory and relevant documents.

* Work on Ruby implementation in parallel.
