Release Notes
Hello readers,

I've been working hard on Chapter 5, the Braintree subscriptions chapter since I last sent out a release. It's getting very close to done, with just the plan restrictions + webhooks sections to complete. I'm very happy about this because I've been working on this one chapter since September and now it's 90% done. I'm looking forward to working on the Stripe chapter after this and getting a much clearer idea for myself how the two compare.

I've updated some of the earlier chapters based on feedback from you. Thanks to those who have provided that.

I'm also going to be having another "sale" soon because it's December and everything's on sale in December. It's also my birthday month: I was born on the 4th of December. I'm releasing this coupon code early because I'm excited about Chapter 5 and some good solid progress.

Here's the coupon code to get the book for $10: <redacted>

If you know of anyone who'd like the book for $10, give them that URL.

Thanks for reading! I really appreciate it.
