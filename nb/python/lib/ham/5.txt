I have set up a Patreon page where you can now help me fund all of my future work.

Patreon is a crowdfunding website that, unlike KickStarter, doesn't have a deadline.

The whole point is to obtain funding from a number of your fans who donate small amounts.

Collectively, it adds up to something that the independent artist can work with.

You can find out more directly from the new Tigris Patreon page.


Until next time. Stay attentive. Be vigilant.
